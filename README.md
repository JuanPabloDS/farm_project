# How to apply for a Developer position

This project is a development test that illustrate a little of what we work with at Agrosatelite.
If you are interested in applying for a position, first download the project and do as documented in the Readme files.

- If you are applying for a **Front-end** developer position (**Analista Desenvolvedor Front-End**) , you can build both the front and the back-ends and focus on the frontend. There might be some itens that require completing the back-end, no it might not be possible to complete all that is asked. But if you are up for a little challenge, you can go ahead and take a chance with the back-end. It will be a nice way to differentiate yourself from other candidates.
- If you are applying for a **Back-end** developer position (**Analista Desenvolvedor Back-End**), the same ideia applies. You can focus on the back, but it will be OK if you try completing the front-end.
- If you have arrived here because of a position published only as **developer** (**Analista Desenvolvedor**), them we spect you do develop both the back-end and the front-end of this project.

Once you are ready to submit your project, please send the repository link through your preferred **Git system** (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket etc.) to e-mail _**agrosatelite@agrosatelite.com.br**_, or according HR instructions.

- **Fill the subject as** (depending on how which position you are applying for):
  - Frontend Dev.;
  - Backend Dev.;
  - Fullstack Dev.;
  - Other.

The subject has to be exactly as described above, or else we might miss your application!

- On the **body of the e-mail** or its **attachments**, send:
  - your **curriculum/CV** together with
  - a **link through which we can download you implementation** of this test.
    - It can be a google drive link for a .zip file, for example,
      - or you can upload in your own public git repository and send us the link.

# Farm Project

The **Farm Project** is incomplete. But you can help us fixing that.

Our aim for this project is that users can create/register farms into the system and, later, search for them according to some parameters.

Currently the project has a frontend and a backend component.

- In the frontend we have provided a web application implemented in Angular 7. However, this application still does not allow the user to draw the farm in a map and send the farm's boundaries to the backend, together with some text parameters.

- In the backend we already have started the project using Django Rest Framework. However, we want you to implement some restrictions on the application. We also expect you to expand it so that it can accept some parameters in the search.

In each project's folder you will find a Readme file. In those files are detailed instructions of the tasks to be done and as well as a guide on how to install and execute the project.
We expect you to download this source, follow the instructions and help is improving this project.

Good luck. We hope that you enjoy the challenge :)
